# Development Protocols

This directory contains the standardized protocols and workflows that Dev Agent implements and enforces.

## ðŸ“‹ Available Protocols

### [High-Efficiency Standard Operating Protocol](high-efficiency-sop.md)

The core development and release management protocol that defines:

- **Branch Management**: Structured Git workflow with protected branches
- **Developer Workflow**: 5-phase feature development process
- **Release Management**: Standardized version release procedures
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and code review requirements
- **Task Management**: Systematic approach to task tracking and completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Protocol Goals

1. **Consistency**: Standardized workflows across all team members
2. **Quality**: Automated quality gates and mandatory code reviews
3. **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes that reduce manual overhead
4. **Reliability**: Predictable outcomes through systematic procedures
5. **Collaboration**: Clear communication and handoff procedures

## ðŸ”„ How Dev Agent Implements These Protocols

Dev Agent automates key aspects of these protocols:

### Task Management

- **AID System**: Unique, typed identifiers for all tasks
- **Status Tracking**: Automatic status updates through the workflow
- **Database Storage**: Persistent task state and history

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Creation**: Automatic feature branch creation with naming conventions
- **Status Validation**: Working directory cleanliness checks
- **Branch Management**: Automated checkout and synchronization

### Quality Assurance

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Integration with quality gates
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized project settings
- **Reporting**: Task status and progress tracking

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Initialize your project** with Dev Agent:

   ```bash
   bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts init
   ```

2. **Configure your repository** according to the protocol requirements

3. **Start following the workflow**:

   ```bash
   # Create a task
   bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts task create "Implement feature X"

   # Start working
   bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts task start g-xxxxxx
   ```

4. **Follow the development phases** as outlined in the protocol

## ðŸ”§ Customization

These protocols can be customized through Dev Agent's configuration system:

```bash
# Configure branch naming
bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts config set branches.feature_prefix "feat"
bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts config set branches.develop "development"

# Configure GitHub integration
bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts config set github.owner "your-org"
bun run dev-agent/src/index.ts config set github.repo "your-project"
```
